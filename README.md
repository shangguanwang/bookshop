### Description:
🛠️ <b>Tools and languages used</b>: 
<ol>
<li><b>Frontend</b>: React (react-router-dom, axios)
<li><b>Backend</b>: MySQL, Node.js Express
</ol>

<br>
🤔 <b>Why I want to create this project</b>: I went to a volunteering event at Women's Prison Book Project and realized it took quite some effort to manually find a specific book from the shelf. If we have a database to allow quick queries of books it would be more efficient for volunteers to pick books. 
<br>
💆‍♀️ <b>Challenges I Faced</b>: The biggest challenge was configuring the MySQL database, I keep hitting "authentication mode not supported" error until I realized MySQL uses a different authentication method and we need to alter root user mysql_native_password. 
<br>
😊 <b>What's fun</b>: Seeing the backend talking to the frond-end for the first time feels amazing. I also enjoyed improving user experience via react-router-dom so users can navigate between different pages seamlessly.

📕 <b>Learning resources</b>: Special thanks to Lama Dev for his amazing course.
